	Abstract = {Logic languages are well suited for declaratively solving computational problems that require knowledge representation and reasoning. Object-oriented programming languages benefit from mature software ecosystems featuring rich libraries and developer tools.
	Several integration solutions exist that allow a software system to be decomposed into a combination of modules implemented in both a logic and an object-oriented language. 
	Unfortunately, significative amounts of boilerplate code must still be written to accomplish the required interoperability. 
	In addition, such approaches often are not amenable to custom context-dependent reification of objects in the logic world and custom mappings of arbitrary logic terms to objects in the object-oriented world.
	Furthermore, in the specific case of Prolog-Java integration, existing solutions are often compatible with only a single or a restricted set of Prolog engines and thus suffer from portability issues.
	To address these problems, we introduce a portable framework, relying on linguistic integration, for transparently and (semi-)automatically enabling communication between routines in these two worlds, as well as a simple mechanism for customising how native artefacts in one language should be reified in the other language. 
	We validate our approach with case studies requiring a seamless integration of declarative programs in Prolog with libraries belonging to the Java ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {While object-oriented programming languages are good at
modelling real-world concepts and benefit from rich libraries and developer
tools, logic programming languages are well suited for declaratively
solving computational problems that require knowledge reasoning. Non-trivial
declarative applications could take advantage of the modelling features
of object-oriented programming and of the rich software ecosystems
surrounding them. Linguistic symbiosis is a common approach to enable
complementary use of languages of different paradigms. However, the
problem of concepts leaking from one paradigm to another often hinders
the applicability of such approaches. This issue has mainly been reported
for object-oriented languages participating in a symbiotic relation with
a logic language. To address this issue, we present LogicObjects, a linguistic
symbiosis framework for transparently and (semi-) automatically
enabling logic programming in Java, that aims to solve most of the problems
of paradigm leaking reported in other works.},

	Abstract = {Logic programming is well suited for declaratively solving computational problems that require knowledge representation and reasoning. Object-oriented languages, on the other hand, are well suited for modeling real-world concepts and profit from rich ecosystems developed around them, which are often missing from logic languages. For applications that require both the declarative power of logic programming and the rich modeling expressiveness and development environments offered by object-oriented languages, there is a need for reconciling both worlds. LogicObjects is our linguistic symbiosis framework for integrating Prolog within the Java language. It extends Java with annotations that allow Java programs to interact transparently and automatically with Prolog programs.},
