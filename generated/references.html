	Abstract = {Integration techniques for combining programs written in distinct language paradigms facilitate the implementation of specialised modules in the best language for their task. In the case of Java-Prolog integration, a known problem is the proper representation of references to Java objects on the Prolog side. To solve it adequately, multiple dimensions should be considered, including reference representation, opacity of the representation, identity preservation, reference life span, and scope of the inter-language conversion policies. This paper presents an approach that addresses all these dimensions, generalising and building on existing representation patterns of foreign references in Prolog, and taking inspiration from similar inter-language representation techniques found in other domains. Our approach maximises portability by making few assumptions about the Prolog engine interacting with Java (e.g., embedded or executed as an external process). We validate our work by extending JPC, an open-source integration library, with features supporting our approach. Our JPC library is currently compatible with three different open source Prolog engines (SWI, YAP and XSB) by means of drivers.},

	Abstract = {The number of approaches existing to enable a smooth interaction between Java and Prolog programs testifies the growing interest in solutions that combine the strengths of both languages. Most of these approaches provide limited support to allow programmers to customise how Prolog artefacts should be reified in the Java world, or how to reason about Java objects on the Prolog side. This is an error-prone task since often a considerable amount of mappings must be developed and organised. Furthermore, appropriate mappings may depend on the particular context in which a conversion is accomplished. Although some libraries alleviate this problem by providing higher-level abstractions to deal with the complexity of custom conversions between artefacts of the two languages, these libraries themselves are difficult to implement and evolve. We claim that this is caused by their lack of appropriate underlying building blocks for encapsulating, categorising and applying Java-Prolog conversion routines. We therefore introduce a new library, JPC, serving as a development tool for both programmers willing to categorise context-dependent conversion constructs in their Java-Prolog systems, and for architects implementing frameworks providing higher-level abstractions for better interoperability between these two languages.},

	Abstract = {Logic languages are well suited for declaratively solving computational problems that require knowledge representation and reasoning. Object-oriented programming languages benefit from mature software ecosystems featuring rich libraries and developer tools.
	Several integration solutions exist that allow a software system to be decomposed into a combination of modules implemented in both a logic and an object-oriented language. 
	Unfortunately, significative amounts of boilerplate code must still be written to accomplish the required interoperability. 
	In addition, such approaches often are not amenable to custom context-dependent reification of objects in the logic world and custom mappings of arbitrary logic terms to objects in the object-oriented world.
	Furthermore, in the specific case of Prolog-Java integration, existing solutions are often compatible with only a single or a restricted set of Prolog engines and thus suffer from portability issues.
	To address these problems, we introduce a portable framework, relying on linguistic integration, for transparently and (semi-)automatically enabling communication between routines in these two worlds, as well as a simple mechanism for customising how native artefacts in one language should be reified in the other language. 
	We validate our approach with case studies requiring a seamless integration of declarative programs in Prolog with libraries belonging to the Java ecosystem.},

modelling real-world concepts and benefit from rich libraries and developer
tools, logic programming languages are well suited for declaratively
solving computational problems that require knowledge reasoning. Non-trivial
declarative applications could take advantage of the modelling features
of object-oriented programming and of the rich software ecosystems
surrounding them. Linguistic symbiosis is a common approach to enable
complementary use of languages of different paradigms. However, the
problem of concepts leaking from one paradigm to another often hinders
the applicability of such approaches. This issue has mainly been reported
for object-oriented languages participating in a symbiotic relation with
a logic language. To address this issue, we present LogicObjects, a linguistic
symbiosis framework for transparently and (semi-) automatically
enabling logic programming in Java, that aims to solve most of the problems
of paradigm leaking reported in other works.},
