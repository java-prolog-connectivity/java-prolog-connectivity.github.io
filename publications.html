	Abstract = {Logic languages excel for problems that can defined declaratively, e.g. applications that require symbolic computation such as expert and planning systems. However, it is often difficult to develop complete applications that require e.g. GUIs, heavy numerical computations, or low-level operating system and network access. On the other hand, object-oriented languages have demonstrated their usefulness for modelling a wide range of concepts (e.g., GUIs) found in many business scenarios. The availability of continuously growing software ecosystems around widely used modern object-oriented languages, including advanced IDEs and rich sets of libraries, has significantly contributed to their success.

Non-trivial applications can profit from implementing their components, or even distinct routines of the same entity, in the language that is most appropriate for expressing them. However, the integration of programs or routines written in different languages is not trivial when such languages belong to different paradigms.

Although numerous approaches allow to integrate Java and Prolog programs, few of them put an emphasis on the transparency and automation of the integration concern at the entity level. In this article, we describe an approach based on the notion of automatic inter-language conversions that does tackle this problem.

<span class="School">Universit√© catholique de Louvain (Belgium)</span>.&nbsp;<span class="Other">Phd thesis</span>.&nbsp;(<span>September,&nbsp;2014</span>).&nbsp;	<span class="BibTex">@phdthesis{2014-phd-castro,
	Abstract = {This dissertation seeks to improve on the state of the art for creating systems integrating modules written in both a logic and a statically-typed object-oriented language. Logic languages are well suited for declaratively solving computational problems that require knowledge representation and reasoning. Modern object-oriented programming languages benefit from mature software ecosystems featuring rich libraries and developer tools. The existence of several integration approaches testifies the interest of both communities in techniques for facilitating the creation of hybrid systems. In this way, systems developed in an object-oriented language can integrate modules written in a logic language that are more convenient for solving declarative problems. On the logic side, non-trivial declarative applications can take advantage of the existence of large software ecosystems such as those surrounding contemporary object-oriented languages. The combination of both paradigms allows a programmer to use the best language available for a given task.

Existing integration approaches provide different levels of abstractions for dealing with the integration concern (i.e., the required interoperability in order for logic routines to access the object-oriented world, and vice versa). Some of them still require significant amounts of boilerplate code which hinders their adoption and steepens their learning curve. Others provide a high degree of integration transparency and automation which simplifies their usage. However, many of those approaches often impose strong assumptions about the architecture of a system (e.g., a logic program must run embedded in an object-oriented one) thus suffering from portability issues. Furthermore, most approaches provide limited support for custom context-dependent reification of objects in the logic world and custom mappings of arbitrary logic terms to objects in the object-oriented world.

To address these problems, we introduce our portable and customisable approach for bidirectional integration between a logic and a statically-typed object-oriented language. This approach enables a transparent and (semi-) automatic communication between routines in these two worlds. In addition, it provides a customisable context-dependent mechanism for defining how artefacts in one language should be reified in the other language. A concrete implementation is provided as a portable Java--Prolog interoperability framework.

To ensure portability, our framework has been made compatible with three open source Prolog engines (SWI, YAP and XSB) by means of drivers.

We validated our approach through case studies requiring a seamless integration of declarative programs in Prolog with object-oriented programs in Java.

	Abstract = {Integration techniques for combining programs written in distinct language paradigms facilitate the implementation of specialised modules in the best language for their task. In the case of Java-Prolog integration, a known problem is the proper representation of references to Java objects on the Prolog side. To solve it adequately, multiple dimensions should be considered, including reference representation, opacity of the representation, identity preservation, reference life span, and scope of the inter-language conversion policies. This paper presents an approach that addresses all these dimensions, generalising and building on existing representation patterns of foreign references in Prolog, and taking inspiration from similar inter-language representation techniques found in other domains. Our approach maximises portability by making few assumptions about the Prolog engine interacting with Java (e.g., embedded or executed as an external process). We validate our work by extending JPC, an open-source integration library, with features supporting our approach. Our JPC library is currently compatible with three different open source Prolog engines (SWI, YAP and XSB) by means of drivers.},

	Abstract = {The number of approaches existing to enable a smooth interaction between Java and Prolog programs testifies the growing interest in solutions that combine the strengths of both languages. Most of these approaches provide limited support to allow programmers to customise how Prolog artefacts should be reified in the Java world, or how to reason about Java objects on the Prolog side. This is an error-prone task since often a considerable amount of mappings must be developed and organised. Furthermore, appropriate mappings may depend on the particular context in which a conversion is accomplished. Although some libraries alleviate this problem by providing higher-level abstractions to deal with the complexity of custom conversions between artefacts of the two languages, these libraries themselves are difficult to implement and evolve. We claim that this is caused by their lack of appropriate underlying building blocks for encapsulating, categorising and applying Java-Prolog conversion routines. We therefore introduce a new library, JPC, serving as a development tool for both programmers willing to categorise context-dependent conversion constructs in their Java-Prolog systems, and for architects implementing frameworks providing higher-level abstractions for better interoperability between these two languages.},

	Abstract = {Logic programming is well suited for declaratively solving computational problems that require knowledge representation and reasoning. Object-oriented languages, on the other hand, are well suited for modeling real-world concepts and profit from rich ecosystems developed around them, which are often missing from logic languages. For applications that require both the declarative power of logic programming and the rich modeling expressiveness and development environments offered by object-oriented languages, there is a need for reconciling both worlds. LogicObjects is our linguistic symbiosis framework for integrating Prolog within the Java language. It extends Java with annotations that allow Java programs to interact transparently and automatically with Prolog programs.},
